# gallocy

## about

This project is the continuation of a [M.S. thesis and project from California
Polytechnic University, San Luis
Obispo](http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/725/), that was just too much
fun to stop working on. *Substantial* improvements have since been made to the
original prototype that was presented in this thesis and now the major focuses
of this project are operability, maintainability, programability, and all the
other nice things that one learns from the software industry. It should be
*fun* to program on gallocy.

If you're interested in using gallocy in your own project or extending gallocy
to support new features or coherency protocols, reach out to us to let us know!
We also have a ton of fun ideas for group projects, M.S. thesis projects, and
even Ph.D. dissertation areas in the fields of binary rewriting and live
process migration.
